# NoteR

NoteR stands for Note Reminder, an app that aims to help the user take note-taking to the next level by leveraging the power of AI.
To do this the app integrates 4 features:
1. NoteChateR: Chatbot integrated with the notes to provide answers based on it, this could be like giving notes, advice, providing old notes, etc for what the user needs.
2. NoteRecommendeR: Recommend notes based on what the user is trying or taking notes for while he's doing so to help him use his existing knowledge and experience.
3. NoteFeedR: A feed of old notes, some may be related to the user's recent activity and some may be random to help the user remember old notes.
4. NoteSearcheR: A smart search that will recommend notes related to your query even if they don't contain it.
5. NotesGroupeR: A feature to gather related notes together by tags to help keep the notes organized and easy to navigate and use.

# Currently
The app contains NoteChateR, NoteRecommendeR, and NoteSearcheR and is available for [Windows](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rEQkEmER5B4H3QIPRTn0gzRYVyCNLYSU/view?usp=sharing)

# Next
I'll be working on NotesGroupeR and NoteFeedR, finalizing the Android version of the app, and providing a web version as well.
